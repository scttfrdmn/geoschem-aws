# GeosChem AWS Platform Development Roadmap

## Current Status: v0.1.0-alpha

‚úÖ **Core Foundation Complete**
- Rocky Linux 9 integration with CIQ official AMIs
- AWS quota checking and management
- Intelligent instance type recommendations  
- Comprehensive AWS setup documentation
- MIT licensing and semantic versioning

## Essential Gaps Analysis

### üö® **Critical Gaps (Must Fix for v0.1.0)**
1. **Missing Terraform Infrastructure** - No actual AWS infrastructure deployment
2. **Incomplete Docker Build Process** - Build execution is stubbed out
3. **No ECR Integration** - Container push/pull not implemented
4. **Missing AWS Batch Setup** - Job execution system not connected
5. **No Real Error Handling** - Production-grade error handling missing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Important Gaps (Should Fix for v0.1.0)**
1. **No Integration Tests** - Can't verify AWS service integration
2. **Missing Configuration Validation** - Users can deploy with bad configs
3. **No Setup Wizard** - Complex manual configuration required
4. **Missing Deployment Scripts** - No automated deployment process

### üí° **Nice-to-Have Gaps (Future Versions)**
1. **Web Interface** - Currently CLI-only
2. **Monitoring/Alerting** - No operational visibility
3. **Cost Tracking** - No spend analysis
4. **Advanced Quota Management** - No automated increase requests

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Terraform Infrastructure

**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

```hcl
# terraform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf                 # Provider and backend configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vpc.tf                  # VPC, subnets, security groups  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ecr.tf                  # Container registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ batch.tf                # Batch compute environment, job queue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iam.tf                  # IAM roles and policies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3.tf                   # S3 buckets for results/web
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf            # Input variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf              # Output values
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/               # Example configurations
```

**Key Features**:
- Optional VPC creation (use existing or create new)
- ECR repository with lifecycle policies
- Batch compute environment with Spot instance support
- IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
- S3 buckets for web hosting and results storage

### 2. Docker Build Implementation

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days

**Current State**: Build execution is stubbed with `time.Sleep(30 * time.Second)`

**Implementation Plan**:
```go
// internal/builder/executor.go
func (b *Builder) executeBuild(ctx context.Context, instanceID string, buildReq BuildRequest, config *common.BuildConfig) error {
    // 1. Wait for user data script completion
    // 2. Connect via SSH or AWS Systems Manager
    // 3. Build Docker container with specified compiler/MPI
    // 4. Push to ECR
    // 5. Clean up build artifacts
}
```

**Components**:
- SSH connection management with key-based auth
- Docker build orchestration on remote instances
- ECR authentication and push
- Build artifact management and cleanup
- Progress monitoring and logging

### 3. AWS Batch Integration

**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Components**:
```go
// internal/batch/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ batch.go              # Batch client and job management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs.go               # Job definition and submission
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring.go         # Job status monitoring
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compute.go            # Compute environment management
```

**Features**:
- Dynamic job definition creation based on container variants
- Job submission with parameter validation
- Status monitoring and result retrieval
- Cost tracking and resource utilization

### 4. Configuration & Setup Wizard

**Priority**: Important
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Interactive Setup**:
```bash
go run cmd/setup/main.go

# Interactive prompts:
# - AWS profile selection
# - Region selection with quota checking
# - Instance type recommendations
# - Budget and scaling preferences
# - Infrastructure deployment options
```

**Features**:
- AWS credential validation
- Region availability checking
- Quota pre-validation
- Configuration file generation
- Infrastructure deployment automation

### 5. Integration Testing

**Priority**: Important
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Test Categories**:
```
tests/integration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws_test.go           # AWS service connectivity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform_test.go     # Infrastructure deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ builder_test.go       # Container building process  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ batch_test.go         # Job execution
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e_test.go          # End-to-end workflow
```
